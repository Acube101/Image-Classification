### Installation :

A good practice to start with a new project and use it, is to make a virtual enviornment for the particular project. Here is the steps for making virtual enviornment ::

1. `pip install virtualenv`
2. `python -m virtualenv myenv`

#### Install the dependencies of the App ::

Run commands on python terminal or anaconda terimial or any terminal you are using in your system.

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Test the app:

* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Acube101/Sports-Celebrity-Image-Classification`
* Go to the project directory
* Go to Server Directory: `cd Server`
* Run the app: `python app.py`
* The development server will be up and running on port 5000 at the URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
* Drag an image of your favourite celebrity from the five and hit the classify button. Our app will predict the celebrity name with his/ her image. It will also show us the percentage match of our image with all the five celebrities.
